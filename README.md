# my emacs config

After the discovery of evil plugin, I gradually thought of converting my religion of editorship from vim to emacs. Since I don't want unhappy `installation-from-remote-package` stuff, this repository contains as much required packages as possible under .emacs.d

## saving your ongoing .emacs + .emacs.d 

```
$ ./scripts/steal
```
## deploying .emacs + .emacs.d of this repository to your local PC.

```
$ ./scripts/install
```
